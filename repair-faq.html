<div class='faqq'>How does this process work?</div>
<div class='faqr'>Fill out <a href='repair-request.php'>the form</a> and wait for us to contact you with either further questions of a <b>Job ID</b>.  When you have the job ID you can then send in your device. We will provide you with an estimate after we've received it. You do not pay until the service is complete.
</div>

<div class='faqq'>How much will the repair cost?</div>
<div class='faqr'>The front page of our <a href='index.html'>site</a> lists the costs of typical jobs.  When you have submitted your repair request form we can provide a better estimate.  You are <em>not obligated</em> to proceed with the job if you change your mind prior to us commencing the repair work.
</div>

<div class='faqq'>How much is return shipping?</div>
<div class='faqr'>For most devices, if the repair is successful, return shipping via Express Post is $26 AUD (within Australia). If the job is a no-fix outcome or you decline to have the device repaired you will have the choice of paying for the return shipping or opting to discard the device.
</div>

<div class='faqq'>Where do I send my device to?</div>
<div class='faqr'>We accept mail-ins with a <em>valid Job-ID</em>. Please ensure your Job-ID is marked on the outside. The address is as follows.
